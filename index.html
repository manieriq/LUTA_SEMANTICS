        <p>Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather <br>
            like a weasel, lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called <i>Miacis</i>, <br>

        <p>American Eskimo Dog combines <mark>striking</mark> good looks with a quick and clever mind in a total <br>
            brains-and-beauty package. Neither shy nor aggressive, Eskies are always alert and friendly, <br>
            though a bit conservative when making new friends. The American Eskimo Dog comes in three sizes <br>
